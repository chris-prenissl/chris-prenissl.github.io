A lot has changed in the world of Android development. This guide should help you get started with setting up 
the Coding Environment, write your first apps and keep you engaged to master your skills and prepare you for
the professional life as an Android Developer. This guide should help especially beginners, but also 
experienced developers should find helpful parts.

_If you want to create your own Android System or dig into
the Android Operating System please refer to [Android Open Source Project](https://source.android.com)_

## Technical Requirements
The most technical expansive tool for Android Development would be _Android Studio_ but with a modern operating 
system (at least Windows 8, MacOS 10.14 or Linux 64bit) with at least 8 GB RAM you should be fine.

## Tools
There aren't many tools necessary, which makes this part easy. Either you install _Java_, _Gradle_, 
Android Emulators and an _Text Editor_ of your choice yourself and stitch everything together, or you go the easy route 
and just install _Android Studio_ which takes care of everything you need for development for Android.
Since _Android Studio_ has a lot of additional conveniences like syntax highlighting for the mentioned tools, 
integration of the Emulator, Debugging tools, and so much more, this guide starts with the installation of Android Studio.

### Installing Android Studio
This part is easy. Just follow [Install Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/install) for your system.
If you want to test the newest features you can install the _Canary build_ or the _Beta build_ (more stable than Canary)
[preview release](https://developer.android.com/studio/preview).

> Preview releases should be carefully used, since they are not stable yet (_Beta build_) or the features 
> are in an experimental state.

### Installing Git
_Git_ is the leading version control system in Software Development.
If you are on Mac or on Linux then you can skip this part, since it is already installed.

For Windows you can install _Git_ via [Download for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win). Make sure 
you choose the right version matching your Windows system.

## Helpful Guides
The best thing about starting Android Development is that there is a large community of developers that are happy to help.
Because there are many documentations, guides and tutorials out there, it is also easy to get lost on where to start. 

### First Steps
Google as the provider of industry standards for Android has many code labs that should help you with every
section in Android Development when you want to have deeper knowledge.

The best way to start your development journey is by doing the 
[Android Basics with Compose](https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-compose/course).
You learn everything from creating your first app, building a UI with Compose, learning Kotlin 
(the industry standard programming language for Android), Accessing the Internet, Databases, managing tasks. 
The code labs also aid you with the Android documentation so you learn how to help your self.

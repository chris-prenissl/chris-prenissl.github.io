Have you ever thought about starting a blog that transforms your ideas into something helpful for everyone,
but put the idea away because of the amount of work it takes for hosting your page and all the tedious backend
solutions?

Don't be afraid! With the *Ruby* Framework **Jekyll** for site generation and free hosting possibilities like
*Github Pages* there is no need for a backend or a complex knowledge in web development.

I share with you my knowledge with you as a Android Developer with little prior experience in web development.
